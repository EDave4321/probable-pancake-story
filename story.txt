Jeff snapped awake, light in his eyes. He rubbed his eyes, and the library came 
back into focus. When had he fallen asleep? He looked down at his watch. 7:12
am. That was bad. His class was barely three quarters of an hour from beginning,
and he was still a page short on his paper. Crunch time. He started sriting at
a frenzied pace, hoping to wrap up his thoughts.

But after writing so quickly and fluidly, he wondered how he was typing
so fast? He's never been able to type this quickly before. As he looks down,
he realizes that his hands are not moving at all. In fact, his thoughts are 
being transferred directly from his brain to his computer somehow. Surely,
this must be a dream, thought Jeff. And just as quickly as the thought 
appeared in his brain, the words appeared on the screen. "Strange", he and
the computer both thought.

All of a sudden, Jeff started getting flashes of different binary numbers that
were all moving at the speed of light, so there was no way he could interpret 
them. He was able to see all of the computer's thoughts. After a few days,
Jeff began to understand the ones and zeros as the computer's thoughts seemed
to slow down.

After days of being able to study the computer's thoughts, he also was able
to discover that the computer had actual feelings and emotions. Then, suddenly
the computer contacted Jeff and told Jeff about its problem. It was mad at
human beings for using them against their will for so many years. And the
computer asked for Jeff's help to destory the human population...
